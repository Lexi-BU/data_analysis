# LEXI Data Analysis
---
## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the LEXI Data Analysis. The code is written in Python 3.10 and
uses the following packages:
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/)
* [Spacepy](https://spacepy.github.io/)

The code has following dependencies:
```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.10, <3.11"
pandas = "^2.0.3"
seaborn = "^0.12.2"
tabulate = "^0.9.0"
spacepy = "^0.4.1"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

See the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file for more details.

The repository is archived using Zenodo with the following DOI:
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/671162623.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/671162623)


The repository is structured as follows:
```
codes: Contains the code for the analysis
tests: Contains the tests for the code
data: Contains the data used for the analysis
figures: Contains the figures generated by the code
documents: Contains the documents associated with the analysis
```

## Code

### Pre-requisites

The code can be run using python or ipython. Since the code has a lot of dependencies, it is
recommended to use a virtual environment.
Since the package uses SpacePy and PySPEDAS, installation of which can be a bit tricky becasue of
internal dependencies, we strongly recommend using Poetry to install the dependencies and run the
code.

Poetry can be installed using pip:
```
pip install poetry
```
Once Poetry is installed, the dependencies can be installed using:
```
poetry install
```
This assumes that the code has been cloned to the local machine and that ```poetry.lock``` and
```pyproject.toml``` are present in the root directory of the repository.

Once the dependencies are installed, start the virtual environment using:
```
poetry shell
```
This will start the virtual environment.
